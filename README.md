We will train and test a deep learning model, YoLoV5, in this tutorial. A GPU would train the deep learning model faster than CPU but a GPU is quite expensive. Luckily, the google provide a free GPU in colab. Thus, We will use the **Google Colab** to train the model.


Steps to train the YoloV5 model for detecting the defects on the pavement:

1. Download this repo into your own computer.

2. download data

- train and validation data-> [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1gIIXfp-jqrDGA_VtqPlmXYdK4JlS0DRI?usp=sharing)

- test data ->  [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1pWsD3-THK2N5V44OhP_7LUl_T5l4G1xX?usp=sharing)

put the downloaded data into the folder in step 1.

4. Open and run the **tutorial.ipynb** using the colab (just double click the file on google drive or right clivk the file and open with colab), there are specific tutorials in the **tutorial.ipynb** to lead you go through the training and testing procedure.

PS: if you get any questions during running this repository, feel free to leave a note in the **issues** (you can see it in the menu bar).
