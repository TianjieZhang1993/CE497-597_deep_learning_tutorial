We will train and test a deep learning model, YoLoV5, in this tutorial. A GPU would train the deep learning model faster than CPU but a GPU is quite expensive. Luckily, the google provide a free GPU in colab. Thus, We will use the **Google Colab** to train the model.


Steps to train the YoloV5 model for detecting the defects on the pavement:

1. Download this repo into your own computer.

2. Upload the whole folder onto your google Drive.





3. open the **train.ipynb**
