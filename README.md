# CE540

We will train and test a deep learning model, YoLoV5, in this tutorial. A GPU would train the deep learning model faster than CPU but a GPU is quite expensive. Luckily, the google provide a free GPU in colab. Thus, We will use the **Google Colab** to train the model.


Steps to train the YoloV5 model for detecting the defects on the pavement:

1. Download this repo into your own computer.

2. download data

- train and validation data-> link: 

- test data ->  link:

put the downloaded data into the folder in step 1.


3. upload the data folders to your Google Drive.



4. Open and run the **train.ipynb**, there are specific tutorials in the **train.ipynb** to lead you go through the training and testing procedure.
